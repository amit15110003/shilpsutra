<p class="text-justify">I love these Juttis for a friends wedding. They are fairly comfortable and the fabric is breathable. I ordered a 38 and they fit better and stretched to a comfortable fit.</p>

<h3 ><b>Vishaka</b></h3>
<p class="text-justify">I buy juttis because I have wide feet and could not wear many other flats. Shilpsutra juttis comes up a bit higher so they feel very comfortable.

<p class="text-justify">Super cute Juttis online. My feet slip walk out of them with every step. I am a 36-37 in other shoes and always a 37 in Shilpsutra. I tried these in both 36 and 37 and they are almost same. </p>
