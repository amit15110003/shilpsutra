<h3 >Juttis</h3><br>
<p class="text-justify">Our Juttis are made of genuine leather and can be easily twisted for comfort. Our design is called Chotta Punja, which was worn by some of the most beautiful queens in the world.</p>
<p class="text-justify">We recommend that you always keep the juttis wrapped in muslin cloth. Muslin cloth lets the product breathe easily and keeps it shining for long.</p>
<p class="text-justify">You would generally not feel the “first pinch” when you wear our Juttis but just in case you do, please apply a very small quantity of mustard oil on the internal line using a cloth soaked in mustard oil. This will soften the leather seam within 24 hours and make it comfortable to wear.</p>


<h3 >Apparel</h3>
<p class="text-justify">We recommend that you always keep the apparels wrapped in muslin cloth. Muslin cloth lets the product breathe easily and keeps it lasting for long. Also, ensure that you always dry clean the products on a regular basis.
